    Sparkle is committed to protecting your privacy online. Our policy explains how we will do this. Sparkles privacy policy covers the collection and use of personal information that may be collected by Sparkle anytime you interact with Sparkle. Please take a moment to read the following to learn more about our information practices, including what type of information is gathered, how the information is used and for what purposes, to whom we disclose the information, and how we safeguard your personal information.
</p>

<h4>
    Why we collect personal information
</h4>
<p>
    Why do we collect your personal information? Because it helps us deliver a superior level of customer service. Your personal information may help us keep you posted on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers, and events that you might like to hear about.
</p>

<h4>
    What information we collect
</h4>
<p>
    There are a number of situations in which your personal information may help us give you better service. For example, we may ask for your personal information when youre downloading a software update, registering for a seminar, participating in an online survey. At such times, we may collect personal information relevant to the situation, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and contact preferences. We collect information for market research purposes - such as your occupation and where you use your computer - to gain a better understanding of our customers and thus provide more valuable service. We also collect information regarding customer activities on our website. This helps us to determine how best to provide useful information to customers and to understand which parts of our websites and Internet services are of most interest to them. If you use a bulletin board or chat room on a Sparkle website you should be aware that any information you share is visible to other users. Personally identifiable information you submit to one of these forums can be read, collected, or used by other individuals to send you unsolicited messages. Sparkle is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.
</p>
<h4>
    When we disclose your information
</h4>
<p>
    Sparkle takes your privacy very seriously. Be assured that Sparkle does not sell or rent your contact information to other marketers. To help us provide superior service, your personal information may be shared with legal entities within the Sparkle group globally who will safeguard it in accordance with Sparkles privacy policy. There are also times when it may be advantageous for Sparkle to make certain personal information about you available to companies that Sparkle has a strategic relationship with or that perform work for Sparkle to provide products and services to you on our behalf. These companies are also obligated to protect your personal information in accordance with Sparkles policies. At times we may be required by law or litigation to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary.
</p>

<h4>
    How we protect your personal information
</h4>
<p>
    SPARKLE will use every reasonable commercial effort to take precautions - including administrative, technical, and physical measures - to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. You can help us by also taking precautions to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure web browser.
</p>

<h4>Integrity of your personal information</h4>
<p>
    Sparkle has safeguards in place to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date for the purposes for which it is used. Naturally, you always have the right to access and correct the personal information you have provided. You can help us ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by checking at http://www.embpower-sparkle.com
